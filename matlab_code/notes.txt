the test* programmes were used to build the workflow but applied to a single file

the order is

test_preprocessing.m            - old "Step1"
test_remove_components.m        - old "Step2"
test_fg.m                       - old "Step3"
	
these follow Amelia in doing the ICA on a per-condition basis. To fix this ther is

new_test_preprocessing.m        - combines "Step1" and "Step2" but does blink removal all in one go



_____________________



note

- in addition to removing front dominated components Amelia had a left
  and right condition, it isn't mentioned in the paper so it has been
  removed.


todo


- check the remove components correctly identifies front channels - DONE

- the ica and blink removal shouldn't be done on a per-condition fashion
